# üè• BHealth Web Application

A **blockchain-powered healthcare management system** designed to provide **secure, transparent, and interoperable** medical data handling between patients, doctors, and clinics. The BHealth Web App integrates **Ethereum smart contracts**, **AI-driven chatbots**, and a **PostgreSQL database** to modernize healthcare operations while ensuring privacy and efficiency.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The **BHealth Web App** aims to resolve critical issues in traditional healthcare systems ‚Äî such as **data fragmentation, inefficiency, and security vulnerabilities** ‚Äî through blockchain technology. By combining **AI automation**, **smart contracts**, and **decentralized data storage**, the platform enables secure and real-time interactions across healthcare stakeholders.

Key objectives:

* Enhance **data security** and integrity through blockchain immutability
* Improve **interoperability** between healthcare providers
* Automate **appointment scheduling** and communication using AI chatbots
* Ensure **transparency and trust** in patient data management

## üß† System Architecture

The BHealth Web App is built on a **three-layer architecture**:

1. **Frontend**

   * Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, jQuery
   * Features: Responsive UI for patients, doctors, and clinics
   * Includes: AI-powered **Padu.AI Chatbot** for appointment booking and reminders

2. **Backend**

   * Technologies: Node.js, Express.js, RESTful APIs
   * Handles authentication, session management, and blockchain interaction
   * Secured with **JWT** authentication and **SSL/TLS encryption**

3. **Blockchain Layer**

   * Platform: **Ethereum** (Sepolia Testnet)
   * Smart contracts coded in **Solidity** using **Hardhat**
   * Functions: Manage CRUD operations (Create, Update, Delete) for appointments, patients, and doctors with blockchain logs
   * Integration via **Infura API**

4. **Database**

   * **PostgreSQL** serves as a blockchain-compatible database
   * Encrypted storage for medical records and user data

5. **Integration & Deployment**

   * AI Chatbot: Integrated using **OpenAI API**
   * Webhooks for real-time synchronization
   * Deployed on **DigitalOcean** with **Nginx** for scalability and performance

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Process

The blockchain implementation followed a **three-phase workflow**:

1. **Initialize Phase**

   * Environment setup (Node.js, Hardhat, Ethers.js, MetaMask)
   * Configuration of local blockchain testing using Sepolia Testnet

2. **Implementation Phase**

   * Smart contract creation for healthcare data management
   * Integration of backend APIs with the blockchain

3. **Deployment Phase**

   * Smart contract deployment to Ethereum testnet
   * Web app hosted via DigitalOcean
   * Frontend and backend connected to live blockchain environment

## üîí Security Features

* **Smart contract audits** (Low-risk rating of 97/100 via SolidityScan)
* **HIPAA and GDPR compliance**
* **SSL/TLS encryption**
* **JWT token-based authentication**
* Immutable blockchain audit trails for all transactions
